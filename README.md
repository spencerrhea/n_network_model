# n_network_model
This repo is for evaluating how network structure influences nitrogen removal in watersheds 

There are two main scripts in this repo. 1) pull_nhd_convr_igraph.R uses NHDplustools to download NHD flowlines and convert them to igraphe objects. 2) n_model.R has all function for the n model and runs the model on all networks.
